CareerCon 2019 - Help Navigate Robots Hackathon on Kaggle

In this hackathon we need to predict the surface as seen by the robots based on the data collected by Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors). It is a multi-class classification problem, where there are 9 types of surfaces as seen by the robot:
- concrete
- soft_pvc
- wood
- tiled
- fine_concrete
- hard_tiles_large_space
- soft_tiles
- carpet
- hard_tiles

We need to predict which floor the robot is on, based on the data collected by sensors like acceleration, velocity, orientation.
