The files in this folder contains code used to clean, manipulate, transform the data along with feature engineering and model training.

The approach used to solve the problem is as follows:
1. Import all datasets available.
2. Check for missing values (Luckily no one in this case :))
3. Do the merging of data as data is divided into two tables using primary and foreign keys.
4. As there are multiple measurements taken for every series, we will transform or take only single measurement from every series.
5. Measurements are extracted by grouping the series on functions : max, min, median, mean, std, absolute maximum and quantiles.
6. We trained the model on RandomForestClassifier using some random hyper-parameters value.
7. Checked the accuracy using 10-Fold cross validation.
8. Checked the feature importance.
9. Making the predictions on test set.
